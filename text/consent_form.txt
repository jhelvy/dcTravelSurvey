**COMPENSATION**

This survey is made available to respondents via Dynata, which offers great diversity in incentives as some people are motivated by cash, points, or by being able to donate to charity. Others are motivated by the chance to make a difference, make their voice heard, have fun taking a survey, helping out, or having a say in the products and services of the future. Others are motivated by learning opportunities provided by the survey or by the promise of receiving information after taking it. Dynata aims to respond to all of these individual motivations in order to provide a sample which is diverse and as representative as possible of the target population. Dynata uses a reasonable level of reward based on the amount of effort required, the population, and appropriate regional customs. Regardless of the type of incentive, the value is the same for every respondent in a given study.
